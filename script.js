I stand and I speak up for others and I attend marches and protests for rights and participate in any kind of protest that will benefit us, young and old, because it will make a change but we have to work together for change. I do this because I strongly believe that the more people who seek change, the quicker the change will come.</p><p>I’m only one, but when it comes to numbers, we can all work to make a difference. I matter, and my voice matters. MLK voiced his concerns, and we should join him in this effort.</p><p>It’s pivotal for all living in the U.S. to stand for social justice issues because without it there wouldn’t be any order. We need a change for future generations to have good morals, positive mindset and to live at peace.</p>"

We cannot be silent in the face of injustice because it is our duty to stand up for our brothers and sisters. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. inspired us to not stay silent, and we must continue his legacy. I have been, in particular, fighting for Muslims, immigrants and black people in this country because I fit into these groups. We live in a country where people are told to go back to their country, the spread of hatred towards Muslims, and black people getting murdered by the police for no reason. We have a leader who promoted hatred and division. What makes people a true patriot is when they fight for the rights of their fellow Americans.</p>"

I fundamentally believe that this world is better when every voice is empowered, when we are not limited by societal expectations, and when we disrupt the status quo to shift paradigms forward.I am inspired by those before me — many of whom are people of color, women, queer, and representative of the diversity that exists in our world. I find hope in the strides that leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were able to make — by speaking truth to power, by working tirelessly for better, and by resisting systems of inequality. I hope to be a part of that same fight, as I hope to follow the lead of those who have been doing this work far longer/better than me.As I look around this world, I see institutionalized racism, patriarchal power, imperialist foreign policy, ignorant leaders, children being left behind, and broken justice systems. I see a world that needs radical change. I am fighting for that world because I believe in the power of humanity to create a more just world, because I believe it’s my responsibility to love this world enough to want to make it better.I fight for better, because InshAllah (God willing), we will be better.</p>"

I believe that his spirit is still alive today because he is still a role model which has inspired and motivated other leaders across the world, including myself.As a Latina activist, I have been participating in different advocacy roles to combat discrimination and racism, while also celebrating and uplifting diversity.I, alongside my friends, founded and developed the Latino Youth Leadership Council (LYLC), a group bringing together students from various high schools in D.C., with the mission to organize and mobilize to assess, develop, and implement opportunities and alternatives for recent immigrant Latino students in D.C. public schools and other educational systems in the District of Columbia.The Latin American Youth Center supports us by providing community organizing support and mobilizing knowledge and skills, and together we are organizing powerful community conferences, youth summits, and we have even created a powerful book called “Voices Without Borders: Our Stories, Our Truth,” hoping to counter the deceiving national anti-immigrant rhetoric that taints and dehumanizes immigrant youth.What I have learned from Martin Luther King is that when we are quiet about the things that matter, darkness gets stronger, injustice rules, and people suffer. This is why I believe that there is power in fighting for what we believe in, especially us, the youth. If we fight, something will change. We must be committed to work hard to make changes and not give up until we get what we need and deserve.I fight for justice, for equity, for a better future, for an education, and to make youth voices be heard because youth voices matter. Youth voices are powerful. Youth have more knowledge than people think, and they need to speak their truth.Too many undocumented youth are scared to speak because they don’t know English and because the real threat of police forces trying to separate them from their families, but we must not stay quiet, just like Martin Luther King did not stay quiet in the face of oppression.I fight and represent undocumented youth because I believe one person can let them know that they are not alone, and — more important — that together we are going to win this fight against injustice.</p>"

I am fighting for Black education. I am fighting for the success of Black America.However, this fight has many scales, and we must remember that there are levels to every fight, just as there are battles in every war. There are some of us who struggle just to get out of bed in the morning. We’re battling ourselves just as we are battling systematic oppression, overt and covert racism, and the invisible White Only signs that exist across America.We are fighting a two-front battle, which makes it hard to see where we’re going and where we can succeed as Black people. Our self-hate is reinforced by their hate, and thus reiterates the vicious cycle of loathing. What I am fighting for is the belief in a future that we have yet to see. I am fighting for children to understand their rights and see their barriers so they can knock them down. As long as difference is used to define us, we will always be segregated. And to answer your question as to why I fight: How can I not? I have been given the access to education and the privilege to study and participate in organizations that fight for our power, our rights, and our excellence. Not everyone has the privilege that I have had to learn about our oppression and articulate it to the world.I see it as my responsibility to fight for those who cannot, to fight for those who are lost to the system, to fight for those who are hidden behind numbers and demographics, and to fight for those whose voice have been muted year after year, generation after generation, time and time again. Young people like Giavonni and I are the Freedom Fighters of today, and we will always stand for our people.</p>"

One of the key driving forces to my activist work is the fact that I know we aren’t where we need to be yet in terms of equity or equality, and Dr. King’s vision for the future in terms of equality still needs to be reached.Through my lens, until my fellow Black college students, especially those at PWI’s, can have a college experience without being targeted, harassed, or physically hurt based off of the color of their skin, there is still work that needs to be done.</p>"

   text: "<p> The legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. has been sanitized over the past half century. He unapologetically campaigned for full employment: jobs for all, abolition of poverty, universal health care, affordable, desegregated housing, and integrated education, but unfortunately, little of this has been fulfilled. Too many Americans are still suffering from economic exploitation, systemic racism, and state violence. Referred to as “ghetto schools” in the 1960s, our urban public schools remain deeply segregated, hamstrung by starvation funding, and thus, ultimately fail to educate the whole child and equip our young people with the ability to think “intensively” and “critically,” a core purpose of education according to King.I have sought to carry on King’s dreams by fighting for a child-centered, equitable public education system for all, not just the offspring of affluent, white families, fair housing measures to integrate our lily-white communities, and a federal job guarantee so that anyone able and willing to work will have a living wage job. We must revive the radical imaginations of our ancestors and struggle for a world free of oppression, violence, and injustice.</p>"
